## Part I Discrete Mathematics

A Fill the blanks from (1) to (2)

1.Assume that an automatic recognizer is used to distinguish boys from a group of people which consists of 10 boys and 8 girls. There are 12 persons recognized as boys by the recognizer. However, only 9 out of these persons are actually boys, other 3 persons are girls.With these statistics, the precision and accuracy if this recognizer are (1) and (2) respectively.

(1)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

9 / (9 + 3) = 0.75

(2)
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

(9 + 0) / (9 + 0 + 3 + 8) = 0.45

2.In the equation of $ y_1 + y_2 + 5y_3 = 12 $, there are 7 solutions of positive integers
(that is, $y_1$, $y_2$, and $y_3$ are all positives) and (3) non-negative integers.

(3)
    1 6 1
    6 1 1
    2 5 1
    5 2 1
    3 4 1
    4 3 1
    1 1 2
    Answer = 6

3.Translate the following 2 statements using logical symbols, such as $ \forall and \exists $, propositional variables, and logical operators. THe logical expression for "There is no maximum integer" is (4) and the logical expression of "Every integer has a unique additive inverse" is (5).

(4)
    ¬∃x (∀y (x ≥ y))

(5)
    ∀x (∃y (x + y = 0)) ∧ ∀x ∀y (x + y = 0 → x = -y)

4.the recurrence relation of the number of moves required for Hanoi tower is $ a_k =  $ (6),where $ a_1 = 1 $, $ a_2 = 3 $

(6)
    $a_k = a_{k-1}+1$

5.Assume that there ar 1 red ball and 2 blue balls in box  1,and 2 red balls and 3 blue balls in box 2. You choose one ball randomly. If you have selected a red ball,
then the probability that you selected a ball from 1st box is  (7).

(7)
    $ \frac{\frac13}{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{3}{5}} = \frac{5}{5+9} = \frac{5}{14}$

6.The number of bit strings of length 10 having more 0s than 1s is (8), and the number of bit strings of length 10 having at least 3 1s is (9).

(8)

$ \frac{10!}{6!4!} + \frac{10!}{7!3!} + \frac{10!}{8!2!} + \frac{10!}{9!1!} + \frac{10!}{10!}$

$ = 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 386 $

(9)

$ 2^{10} - \frac{10!}{8!2!} - \frac{10!}{9!1!} - \frac{10!}{10!} $

$ = 1024 - 45 - 10 -1 = 968 $

B. True or false (2 pts each for a correct answer and -1 point for a wrong answer) .

1.(T) Incidence matrix, for graph representation, is a symmetric matrix.

2.(T) The cardinality of Q is the same as the cardinality of Z. (qp)",

3.(T) Among 100 people there are at least 9 who were born in the same month.

4.(?) (P(S), $\subseteq$) is a partially ordered set, where P(S) is a power set of S={1,2,4}.

5.(T)"-p→q" is logicallyequivalent to " (q→p)" where stands for "not"

| p | q | $ \neg p \rightarrow q $ | $ \neg (p \leftrightarrow q) $ |
|:-:|:-:|:------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| 0 | 0 |            0             |              0                 |
| 1 | 0 |            1             |              1                 |
| 0 | 1 |            1             |              1                 |
| 1 | 1 |            0             |              0                 |

6.(F) There are 81 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 different boxes.

put 2 dividor into 4 balls, then it'll be the answer.

$ \frac{6!}{2!} = 6*5*4*3 = 360$

7.(T) Traveling salesman problem is the problem to find an Euler circuit of least cost.
