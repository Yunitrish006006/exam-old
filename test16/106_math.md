1. Let A and B square matrices such that AB = I. For each of the following statements, indicate whether the statement is true or  false, repectively. If the statement is true, prove it. If the statement is false, give a counterexample.
    - (a) 0 is not an eigenvalue of B.
    - (b) A is diagonalzable.
    - (c) The equation (A-B)x = 0 has only solution x = 0.
    - (d) A and B are row equivalent to each other.
    - (e) $A^TB^T = I$
2. Let $u_1 = (3,2,1), u_2 = (2,3,0)$,and the set $U = Span{u1,u2}$.
    - (a) Find the orthogonal complement of U.
    - (b) Find the orthogonal projection of (1,1,-1) onto U.
3. Let T(x) = Ax, where A is a $5 \times 4$ matrix of rank 3.
    - (a) What are the dimensions of the domain of T, the kernal of T, and the range of T.
    - (b) Given an example of such a matrix A and justify your answer.
4. By least squares, find the equation of the form $y = ax^2$ that best fits the following data.$\begin{array}{cc}x&y\\\hline -1&1\\0&1\\1&2\\\end{array}$
