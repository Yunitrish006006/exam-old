2. Ans:
    1. The difference between dynamic loading and dynamic linking indicates that loading put the resource into the program resource block, while linking only provide the address of memory to the program.
    2. Processor affinity is the probability of dispatching of a thread to the processor that was previously executing it.
    3. Priority inversion, caused by preemptive resource, results in  low priority execute earlier than high priority process.
    4. semaphore compared to spin-lock's busy-waiting is only sleep, this can make whole system more efficiency and less resource consumed.
3. Ans:
    1. CPU execution time = IC * CPI / Clock Rate
    2. Instruction decode time reduce due to the combine of two instructions, thus it'll cause all being more effiency
4. Ans:
    1. conditions that can occur in a pipelined machine that obstacle the execution of a subsequent
    2. It may occured decoder problem when two instruction decode at the same time
5. Ans:
    - Branch History Table, which use to record the branch history that helps predict the branch that'll jump to.
    - if we can know the past two record is definately better than only one pass record,
        - 2 bit: 11 => 1, 10 => 0, 01 => 1, 00 => 0
        - 1 bit: 1 => 1, 0 => 0
6. Ans: 11, 5
7. Ans:
    1. For Device security
    2. For better software and hardware fitness
    3. For smaller hardware size
