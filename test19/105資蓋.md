## Part 2. Operating systems

- 15.Please explain the following terms.

    (a) Locality of references

    > the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations

    (b) Inverted page table

    > Inverted Page Table is the global page table which is maintained by the Operating System for all the processes.

    (c) Context switch

    >  a procedure that a computer's CPU follows to change from one task/process to another while ensuring that the tasks do not conflict

- 16.Please briefly answer the following questions.

    (a) The dual mode operation is provided by OS or CPU?

    > the ability of the system to switch between two different modes of operation for computation processes and to avoid system crashes

    (b) The goal of dual mode operation is to support protection. How to achieve protection by dual mode operation?

    > User mode restricts access to privileged resources, while kernel mode has full access to these resources

    (c) The application runs in the user mode and the OS runs in the kernel mode. Is it possible to also execute OS in the user mode? If not, please explain your reasons.

    > 1. Security Vulnerabilities: If OS code were to run in user mode, it would be susceptible to attacks from malicious user applications. These applications could exploit vulnerabilities in the OS code to gain unauthorized access to sensitive system resources or even take control of the entire system.
    > 2. System Instability: Running OS code in user mode would introduce the possibility of user applications directly interacting with hardware and other critical system resources. This could lead to system crashes, data corruption, and other unpredictable behavior.
    > 3. Limited Control: The OS relies on privileged access to hardware and system resources to perform its essential functions, such as memory management, process scheduling, and device I/O. Running in user mode would restrict the OS's ability to efficiently manage these resources and maintain system stability.

    (d) When a process executes an instruction to turn off the interrupt while in the user mode, what problem would be occurred?

    > 1. Unresponsiveness: If a process disables interrupts and enters a long-running operation, the system will become unresponsive to user input or external events. This is because the OS cannot receive interrupt signals to handle user requests or respond to external events while interrupts are disabled.
    > 2. Deadlocks: If multiple processes disable interrupts and attempt to access shared resources, it can lead to deadlocks. A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting for resources held by each other, and neither can proceed without the other's resource. Deadlocks can cause the system to hang or crash.
    > 3. Failure to Handle Time-Sensitive Events: If interrupts are disabled for an extended period, the system may fail to handle time-sensitive events, such as network traffic, timer interrupts, or hardware signals. This can lead to missed deadlines, data loss, or system instability.
    > 4. Masking Critical Interrupts: Disabling interrupts can mask critical interrupts that are essential for system operation. For instance, if a process disables interrupts and then encounters a hardware error, the OS will not be able to receive the interrupt signal to handle the error, potentially leading to system instability or data corruption.

    (e) Please list all of the possible cases that the mode would switch from user mode into the kernel mode.

    > 1. System Calls: When a user-mode process invokes a system call, it initiates a mode switch to kernel mode. System calls are requests for services that user-mode processes cannot perform directly, such as accessing hardware devices, managing files and memory, or interacting with other processes.
    > 2. Exceptions: Exceptions are unexpected events that occur during program execution, such as memory access violations, division by zero, or illegal instructions. When an exception arises, the processor triggers a mode switch to kernel mode, allowing the OS to handle the exception and determine the appropriate course of action.
    > 3. Interrupts: Interrupts are signals sent to the processor by hardware devices or software to notify it of important events, such as input from a keyboard or mouse, timer events, or hardware errors. Upon receiving an interrupt, the processor switches to kernel mode, allowing the OS to handle the interrupt and respond to the event accordingly.
    > 4. Traps: Traps are similar to exceptions but are caused by specific instructions or conditions within the program itself. For instance, a trap might occur when a program attempts to execute a privileged instruction or exceeds its memory limits. Traps also trigger a mode switch to kernel mode, allowing the OS to handle the situation.
    > 5. Synchronization Primitives: User-mode processes may voluntarily switch to kernel mode when using synchronization primitives, such as semaphores or mutexes. These primitives often involve kernel intervention to coordinate access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.
    > 6. Scheduled Preemption: The OS may periodically preempt user-mode processes and switch to kernel mode to perform essential tasks such as process scheduling, memory management, or system maintenance. This ensures that critical OS functions are not hindered by long-running user-mode processes.

- 17.The registers are very high speed memory and are within CPUs. However, the process control block (PCB) or processor descriptor also have the register field. Why?
    > PCBs have a register field to store a copy of a process's register values when the process is not running. This is important because registers are fast memory located within the CPU, but their contents are lost when the power is turned off or the CPU is reset. By storing the register values in the PCB, the operating system can save the state of a process and restore it later when the process is scheduled to run again. This allows the operating system to efficiently manage multiple processes without losing their state or data.
