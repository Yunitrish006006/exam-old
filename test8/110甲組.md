詳解:

（a）錯誤

如果圖中每個邊的權重都增加 1，那麼所有最短路徑的總權重也會增加 1。因此，即使所有邊的權重都增加了，最短路徑仍將保持最短路徑。

（b）錯誤

最小生成樹是圖中所有邊的一個子集，它以最小的總權重連接圖的所有頂點。最小生成樹中任何一對頂點之間的路徑不一定是圖中的最短路徑。

（c）正確

如果圖的頂點可以分成兩個不相交的集合 L 和 R，使得每個邊都有一個頂點在 L 中，另一個頂點在 R 中，則該圖是二分的。每棵樹都是二分的，因為頂點可以分成兩組：葉子節點和非葉子節點。

（d）正確

Edmonds-Karp 算法用於在二分圖中尋找最大匹配，它是基於最大流算法的。

（e）錯誤

對於任何網絡，都不一定存在邊，使得增加邊的容量會增加網絡的最大流。事實上，可能存在這樣的網絡，其中增加任何邊的容量都不會增加最大流。

因此，正確的陳述是（c）和（d）。
