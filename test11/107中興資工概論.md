3. Given a two-dimensional array A declared as follows: (8%) $int A[100][100];$ where each integer occupies four bytes and $A[0][10]$ is at location 1,600 in a paged memory system with page of size 1,600. A small process for manipulating the matrix resides in page 0 (location 0 to 1599); thus, every instruction fetch will be from page O. For three page frames, how many page faults are generated by the following array initialization loops, using LRU replacement and assuming that page frame 1 has the process in it, the other two are initially empty, and the array is stored in memory row by row?
    - (a)

    ``` c++
        for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < 100; jt+)

    ```

    - (b)

    ``` c++
        for (int j=0;j<100;jt+)
