1.Find all solutions to the system of congruences $x \equiv 1(mod2)$,$x \equiv 2(mod3)$,$x \equiv 3(mod5)$,and $x \equiv 4(mod11)$.

$
x \equiv y_1 (mod 2),
x \equiv y_2 (mod 3),
x \equiv y_3 (mod 5),
x \equiv y_4 (mod 11)
$

$
M_1 = 165 (mod 330),
M_2 = 110 (mod 330),
M_3 = 66 (mod 330),
M_4 = 30 (mod 330)
$

$x = y_1 M_1 + y_2 M_2 + y_3 M_3 + y_4 M_4 (mod 330)$

$x = 165 + 110 + 330 + 120 (mod 330)$

$x = 725 (mod 330)$

2.How many bit strings of length 10 contain at least four 1s?

- $ 2^{10} - \frac{10!}{4!6!} - \frac{10!}{3!7!} - \frac{10!}{2!8!} - \frac{10!}{1!9!} - \frac{10!}{10!}$

- $1024 - 210 - 120 -45 - 10 - 1 = 638$

3.Solve the following recurrence relation together with initial conditions given.

$a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6 a_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2, a_0 = 1, a_1 = 0$

特徵函數
$r^2−5r+6=0$

$a_n = c_1 2^n +c_2 3^n$

$\because a_0 = 1, c_1 + c_2 = 1$ , and $a_1 = 0, 2c_1+3c_2 = 0$

$\therefore a_n = \frac{1}{8} 2^n + \frac{7}{8} 3^n$

4.Which of these relations on the set {1,2,3,4} are antisymmetric and transitive?

- (a) {(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4)}

    Antisymmetric: False. (2,3) and (3,2) are both in the relation.

    Transitive: True. Since (2,3) and (3,4) are in the relation, then (2,4) is also in the relation.

- (b) {(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)}

    Antisymmetric: False. (1,2) and (2,1) are both in the relation.

    Transitive: False. Since (1,2) and (2,3) are in the relation, then (1,3) is not necessarily in the relation.

- (c) {(2,4),(4,2)}

    Antisymmetric: False. (2,4) and (4,2) are both in the relation.

    Transitive: False. Since (2,4) and (4,3) are not in the relation, then (2,3) is also not in the relation.

- (d) {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)}

    Antisymmetric: False. (1,2) and (2,1) are both in the relation.

    Transitive: False. Since (1,2) and (2,4) are in the relation, then (1,4) is not necessarily in the relation.

- (e) {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)}

    Antisymmetric: True.

    Transitive: True.

$wx\bar{y}\bar{z} + \bar{y}x\bar{y}\bar{z} + w\bar{x}\bar{y}\bar{z} + \bar{w}\bar{x}\bar{y}\bar{z}$

$x\bar{y}\bar{z} + w\bar{y}\bar{z} + \bar{x}\bar{y}\bar{z} + \bar{w}\bar{y}\bar{z}$

$x\bar{y}\bar{z} + (w + \bar{x} + \bar{w}) \bar{y}\bar{z}$

$x\bar{y}\bar{z} + \bar{y}\bar{z}$

1.Let A be a $4 \times 3$ matrix of rank 3.

- (a) Given a simple example of such  a matrix A, Justify your answer.

$A=\begin{vmatrix}1,2,3\\0,1,4\\0,0,0\\1,1,1\end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}1,2,3\\0,1,4\\0,0,0\\0,0,0\end{vmatrix}$

- (b) What is the dimension of the null space of A?

The dimension of the null space of A is equal to the number of linearly independent columns in A that are not in the column space of A. Since A has rank 3, it has 3 linearly independent columns. Since A is a 4×3 matrix, it has 1 column that is not in the column space of A. Therefore, the dimension of the null space of A is 1.

- (c) What is the dimension of the column space of A?

The dimension of the column space of A is equal to the rank of A. Therefore, the dimension of the column space of A is 3.

2.Find the Point Q on the line $ y = x \div 3$ that is closest to the point (1,4).

距離公式: $d = sqrt((x - 1)^2 + (y - 4)^2)$

本題: $d = sqrt((x - 1)^2 + ((x/3) - 4)^2)$

微分: $(x - 1) + (x/3 - 4) / 3 = 0$

答案: [3,1]

3.Let ${u_1,u_2,u_3}$ be an orthonormal basis for an inner product space. If $x = c_1u_1 + c_2u_2 + c_3u_3$ is a vector with properties ||x|| = 5,$\langle x,u_1\rangle = 4$ and $x \bot u2$ then what are the possible values of $c_1,c_2,c_3$?

$\|x\|^2 = (x, x) = (c_1 u_1 + c_2 u_2 + c_3 u_3, c_1 u_1 + c_2 u_2 + c_3 u_3)$

$5^2 = (c_1)^2 + 0^2 + (c_3)^2$

$\because\langle x,u_1\rangle = 4$

$\therefore 4 = (c_1 u_1 + c_2 u_2 + c_3 u_3, u_1)$

$
c_1 = 4,
c_2 = 0,
c_3 = \pm 3
$

$x = 4 u_1 + 3 u_3$ or $x = 4 u_1 - 3 u_3$

4.Suppose A is a $3 \times 3$ matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_2 = 2$ Suppose also that A - I has rank one.

- (a) which eigenvalue of A is reapeted? Justify your answer.

$\lambda_i = \dim(E_{\lambda_i})$

$(A - \lambda_i I)x = 0$

$E_1 = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x = \alpha u_1 + \beta u_2\}$

$E_2 = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x = \gamma u_3\}$

$(A-2I)u_3 = 0$

=> repeated: 1

- (b) Give a simple matrix B which is symmetric and similar to A. Justify your answer.

assert $B = \begin{vmatrix}1,0,1\\0,2,0\\1,0,1\end{vmatrix}$

$B^T = \begin{vmatrix}1,0,1\\0,2,0\\1,0,1\end{vmatrix}$

$A=PBP^{−1}$
$P = \begin{vmatrix}1,1,0\\0,1,0\\0,0,1\end{vmatrix}$

$
A = \begin{vmatrix}1,2,3\\0,1,4\\0,0,0\end{vmatrix}
= \begin{vmatrix}1,1,0\\0,1,0\\0,0,1\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}1,0,1\\0,2,0\\1,0,1\end{vmatrix}\begin{vmatrix}1,1,0\\0,1,0\\0,0,1\end{vmatrix}
$

=> thus B is symmetric and similar to A

5.Consider the vector space of polynominals of the form $p(x) = ax^3 + ^2 + cx + d$. Are the following subspaces? Explain briefly.

- (a) Those p(x) for which p(1) = 0.
  - 必須滿足三個
    - It contains the zero vector.
    - It is closed under addition.
    - It is closed under scalar multiplication.
  - $(p(x) + q(x))(1) = p(1) + q(1) = 0 + 0 = 0$
  - $(cp(x))(1) = c(p(x))(1) = c \cdot 0 = 0$
  - cp(x) also satisfies the condition p(1)=0, so it is a subspace
- (b) Those p(x) for which p(0) = 1.
  - (p(x) + q(x))(0) = p(0) + q(0) = 1 + 1 = 2
  - (cp(x))(0) = c(p(x))(0) = c \cdot 1 = c
  - Therefore, the product cp(x) does not necessarily satisfy the condition p(0)=1, and is therefore not necessarily in the subspace.
  - Since the subspace does not satisfy the property of closure under addition or the property of closure under scalar multiplication, it is not a subspace.
- (c) Those p(x) for which a + b = c + d.
  - $(a + b) + (c + d) = (c + d) + (a + b) = 2(a + b) = 2(c + d)$
  - $c(a + b) = c(c + d) = 2(c + d)$
  - Therefore, the product cp(x) also satisfies the condition a+b=c+d, and is therefore in the subspace.
  - Since the subspace satisfies all three properties, it is a subspace.
