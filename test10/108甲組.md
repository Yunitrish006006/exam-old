1.A multiprogramming operating system uses paging. The available memory is 100 MB divided into 25 frames, each of 4 MB. The first program needs 13 MB, the second program needs 17 MB, and the third program needs 30 MB.

- (a) How many frames are unused? (2 pts)

    25 -4 -5 -8 = 8
- (b) What percentage of memory wasted? (2 pts)

    $\frac{3+3+2}{4+5+8} = 47%$

2.The bit pattern (1100 1010 0000 0000 0111 0001 0000 1111)2 is stored in Excess_127 format. Show the value
in decimal. (6 pts)

      1100 1010 0000 0000 0111 0001 0000 1111
    - 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111
    ---------------------------------------------
      0000 1010 1111 1111 1000 0001 0000 0000

    10 * 256 + 255 * 16 + 129 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 65535

3.Using an 8-bit allocation, first convert each of the following number to sign-and-magnitude representation, do the operation, and then convert the result to decimal.

- a. 19-23 (4 pts)

        Step 1: Determine the sign of the number.

        19-23 is negative, so the sign bit is set to 0.

        Step 2: Convert the magnitude of the number to binary.

        The magnitude of 19-23 is 4. The binary representation of 4 is 100.

        Step 3: Combine the sign bit and the magnitude bits to form the sign-and-magnitude representation of the number.

        The sign-and-magnitude representation of 19-23 is 0100.

        Result:

        The decimal value of 0100 in sign-and-magnitude representation is -4.
- b.-19-23(4 pts)

        Step 1: Determine the sign of the number.

        -19-23 is negative, so the sign bit is set to 0.

        Step 2: Convert the magnitude of the number to binary.

        The magnitude of -19-23 is 42. The binary representation of 42 is 101010.

        Step 3: Combine the sign bit and the magnitude bits to form the sign-and-magnitude representation of the number.

- (b) Cycles per instruction.
- (c) Instruction level parallelism.
- (d) Instruction set architecture.

ANS: d

(2) A program P runs in 20 seconds on computer A, which has a 2 GHz clock rate. We try to build a computer B, that will run the program P in 10 seconds. We have determined that a substantial increase in the clock rate is possible, but this increase will cause computer B to require 1.5 times as many clock cycles as computer A for the program P. What clock rate should the computer B have?

- (a) 4 GHz
- (b) 6 GHz
- (c) 8 GHz
- (d) 10 GHz

Time_A = 20 seconds
Clock rate_A = 2 GHz
Clock cycles_A = Time_A \* Clock rate_A = 20 seconds \* 2 GHz = 40 billion clock cycles
Clock cycles_B = 1.5 \* Clock cycles_A = 1.5 \* 40 billion clock cycles = 60 billion clock cycles

Time_B = Clock cycles_B / Clock rate_B

10 seconds = 60 billion clock cycles / Clock rate_B

Clock rate_B = 60 billion clock cycles / 10 seconds = 6 GHz

ANS: b

(3) About the addressing mode, which of the following statements is false?

- (a) PC-relative addressing, where the desired operand is at the memory location whose address is
the sum of the PC and a constant in the instruction.
- (b) Register indirect addressing, where the instruction contains the number of a register that
contains the memory address of the desired operand.
- (c) Immediate addresing, where the desired operand can be fetched from the instruction cache
immediately.
- (d) Base or displacement addressing, where the desired operand is at the memory location whose
address is the sum of a register and a constant in the instruction.

ANS: c

(4) Below is the outcome of a branch during the program execution, where T for taken and N for not taken.

T       | S            | T        | S |
N       | S            | N        | W (weakly predict not taken)|
T       | W            | T        | S |
T       | S            | T        | S |
N       | S            | N        | W |
T       | W            | T        | S |

ANS: c

(5) Suppose we have a processor with a clock rate of 2 GHz, and a base CPI of 1.0 if all references hit
in the primary cache. Assume a main memory access time of 100ns, including all the miss handling.
If the miss rate per instruction at the primary cache is 2%, what's the total CPI?

- (a) 2.0
- (b) 3.0
- (C) 4.0
- (d) 5.0

CPI_miss = miss_rate \* memory_access_time / (1000 \* clock_rate)

CPI_miss = 0.02 \* 100ns / (1000 \* 2 GHz) = 1.0ns

total_CPI = base_CPI + CPI_miss

total_CPI = 1.0 + 1.0ns = 2.0

ANS: a

(6) About the reservation station, which of the following statements is true?

- (a) The buffer within a functional unit that holds the operands and operation.
- (b) A small memory that is indexed by the lower portion of the address of the branch instruction
and that contains one or more bits indicating whether the branch was recently taken or not.
- (c) The buffer that holds results in a dynamically scheduled processor until it is safe to store the
results to memory or a register.
- (d) A table that keeps track of recently used address mappings to avoid an access to the page table.

ANS: c

(7) Assume a cache has 64K words, block size is 8-word, and word size is 4-byte. For a 32-bit address,
what's the tag length in case of 8-way set associative.

- (a) 15-bit
- (b) 16-bit
- (c) 17-bit
- (d) 18-bit

Tag length = Address length - Index length - Offset length

Index length = log2(number of sets)

Number of sets = 64K words / 8 words/block * 4 bytes/word = 2^18

Tag length = 32 bits - 18 bits - 3 bits = 11 bits

- (c) $x\bar{x_1}x_2 + x_1\bar{x_3}$
- (d) $\bar{x_1}x_2 + x_3\bar{x_2}$

| x1 | x2 | x3 | f |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

f(x1, x2, x3) = $\bar{x_1}x_2 + x_3\bar{x_2}$

(9) Which statement is not the key feature of write-back used in the cache?

- (a) Individual words can be written by the processor at the rate that the cache, rather than the

- (d) When blocks are written back, the write allocate policy is usually used to improve the write
